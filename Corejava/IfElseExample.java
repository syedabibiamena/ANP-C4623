//In this example, we use the Scanner class to read input from the user. We first create a new Scanner object by passing System.in as an argument to the constructor. This sets up the scanner to read input from the standard input stream, which is usually the keyboard.
//We then use the println() method to prompt the user to enter a number. We read the input from the user using the nextInt() method of the scanner object, and store the result in the number variable.
//We then use an if-else statement to determine whether number is positive, negative, or zero, just like in the previous example. The only difference is that instead of initializing number with a fixed value, we read it from user input.
//Finally, we close the scanner using the close() method to free up any resources used by the scanner.
